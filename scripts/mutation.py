"""Run cosmic-ray mutation testing in parallel and report the mutation score.

cosmic-ray mutates the source tree in place, so every shard works on its own copy of the project. The work items of
each module in the main session are split over the shards, executed concurrently, and the results are merged back into
the main session for reporting. A shard runs the tests of its own module first, because they kill most mutants of that
module, and all shards share one cache of fitted models. A progress line appears every minute.

Usage: ``uv run python scripts/mutation.py [shards] [--base REF | --module PATH ...]``. With ``--base``, only the
mutants on the lines that changed since ``REF`` run. With ``--module``, all mutants of the given modules run. Exits
non-zero if any mutant survives.
