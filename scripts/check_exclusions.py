"""Fail when an ``exclude-newer-package`` exemption in ``pyproject.toml`` is no longer needed.

uv skips releases that are newer than the cutoff ``exclude-newer = "N days"``. An entry in ``exclude-newer-package``
lets one package skip that rule, for example to take a security fix at once. The entry is temporary: it is redundant
when every file of the locked version is older than the cutoff, or when the package is not in the lock. This check
reads ``uv.lock`` and fails then, so the exemption is removed. Run it from the repo root:
``uv run python -m scripts.check_exclusions``.
